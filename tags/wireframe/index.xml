&lt;p>&lt;strong>Welcome aboard, future web architects!&lt;/strong> This module lays the foundation for your exciting journey into the world of web development and engineering. Buckle up as we explore the intricate tapestry of the web, unraveling its purpose, technology, and underlying principles.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-web-an-ocean-of-information">The Web: An Ocean of Information&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before we dive deep, let&amp;rsquo;s define our playground. The &lt;strong>web&lt;/strong> isn&amp;rsquo;t just a collection of websites; it&amp;rsquo;s a vast, interconnected network of documents and resources, accessible through &lt;code>hyperlinks&lt;/code> and accessed using web &lt;code>browsers&lt;/code>. It&amp;rsquo;s a living breathing entity, constantly evolving, and serving its primary purpose: connecting people and information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Imagine an endless library with shelves upon shelves of information, connected by magical threads you can click to explore further - that&amp;rsquo;s the web!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="web-vs-internet-not-identical-twins">Web vs. Internet: Not Identical Twins&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t confuse the web with its underlying infrastructure, the &lt;strong>internet&lt;/strong>. The internet is the network of networks, the cables and &lt;em>&lt;strong>protocols&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> that allow communication between computers worldwide. Think of it as the highways and traffic lights, while the web is the vibrant city built upon them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="web-servers-browsers-and-hyperlinks-the-webs-symphony">Web Servers, Browsers, and Hyperlinks: The Web&amp;rsquo;s Symphony&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now, meet the key players behind the scenes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Web servers:&lt;/strong> These tireless workhorses store and deliver website content upon request. Imagine them as libraries housing millions of books, ready to be dispatched to eager readers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Web browsers:&lt;/strong> These are your windows to the web, interpreting and displaying the information delivered by web servers. It&amp;rsquo;s like your personal reading device, transforming bytes into beautiful, interactive experiences.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Hyperlinks:&lt;/strong> These are the web&amp;rsquo;s magic connectors, weaving pages together. They&amp;rsquo;re the clickable pathways that let you navigate from one corner of the web to another, seamlessly and with a single click.

&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="how-the-internet-makes-the-web-dance">How the Internet Makes the Web Dance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s peek under the hood and witness the internet&amp;rsquo;s magic trick: data transmission. It all starts with your request, which travels through the internet as tiny &lt;strong>packets&lt;/strong>, carrying unique identifiers like
&lt;abbr title=An&amp;#32;Internet&amp;#32;Protocol&amp;#32;address&amp;#32;(IP&amp;#32;address)&amp;#32;is&amp;#32;a&amp;#32;numerical&amp;#32;label&amp;#32;such&amp;#32;as&amp;#32;192.0.2.1&amp;#32;that&amp;#32;is&amp;#32;assigned&amp;#32;to&amp;#32;a&amp;#32;device&amp;#32;connected&amp;#32;to&amp;#32;a&amp;#32;computer&amp;#32;network&amp;#32;that&amp;#32;uses&amp;#32;the&amp;#32;Internet&amp;#32;Protocol&amp;#32;for&amp;#32;communication.&amp;#32;IP&amp;#32;addresses&amp;#32;serve&amp;#32;two&amp;#32;main&amp;#32;functions:&amp;#32;network&amp;#32;interface&amp;#32;identification,&amp;#32;and&amp;#32;location&amp;#32;addressing.>
&lt;strong>IP Address&lt;/strong>
&lt;/abbr>
and &lt;strong>sequence numbers&lt;/strong>. Think of them as numbered mail packages finding their way through complex sorting centers, guided by &lt;strong>DNS&lt;/strong> (the internet&amp;rsquo;s phonebook) and clever algorithms choosing the &lt;strong>best route&lt;/strong>. Every packet&amp;rsquo;s safe arrival is confirmed with an &lt;strong>acknowledgement&lt;/strong>, ensuring smooth delivery of information.
&lt;img src="../intro_packet.png" alt="Packet Switching">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
1. Packets:
&lt;/summary>
In data networking, a packet is a small segment of a larger message. Data sent over computer networks, such as the Internet, is divided into packets. These packets are then recombined by the computer or device that receives them. Each packet contains both the data being transmitted and information about the data, such as the source and destination addresses, the sequence number, and the size of the packet.
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
2. IP Addresses:
&lt;/summary>
An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label such as 192.0.2.1 that is assigned to a device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses serve two main functions: network interface identification, and location addressing.
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
3. Sequence Numbers:
&lt;/summary>
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) uses a sequence number to identify each byte of data. The sequence number identifies the order of the bytes sent from each computer so that the data can be reconstructed in order, regardless of any out-of-order delivery that may occur.
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
4. DNS (Domain Name System):
&lt;/summary>
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
5. Best Route:
&lt;/summary>
The best path is selected by a routing protocol based on the value or metric it uses to determine the distance to reach a network. A metric is the quantitative value used to measure the distance to a given network. The best path to a network is the path with the lowest metric.
&lt;/details>
&lt;details>
&lt;summary>
6. Acknowledgement:
&lt;/summary>
In data networking, telecommunications, and computer buses, an acknowledgment (ACK) is a signal that is passed between communicating processes, computers, or devices to signify acknowledgment, or receipt of message, as part of a communications protocol.
&lt;/details>&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="behind-the-scenes-the-journey-of-a-web-page">Behind the Scenes: The Journey of a Web Page&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Let&amp;rsquo;s follow the path of a web page from the moment you type a URL to the instant it appears on your screen. It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating journey involving multiple actors and a precise choreography of steps.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. User Initiates the Journey:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You enter a URL (like &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.example.com">www.example.com&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;) into the browser&amp;rsquo;s address bar.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. DNS Lookup: Finding the Address:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The browser contacts a DNS (Domain Name System) server, the internet&amp;rsquo;s phonebook, to translate the human-readable URL into a numerical IP address that computers understand.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. Browser Sends a Request:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The browser crafts a well-formatted HTTP request message, containing the URL, browser information, and other relevant details. It sends this message across the internet, aiming for the server at the specified IP address.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>4. Server Receives and Responds:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The web server, constantly listening for incoming requests, receives the message. It locates the requested web page files on its storage and packages them into a response message.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5. Packet Delivery: The Journey Home:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The server sends the response message back to the browser, broken down into smaller packets of data. These packets travel through various routers and networks, finding the optimal path to reach the user&amp;rsquo;s device.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>6. Browser Reassembles and Renders:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The browser receives the packets, reassembles them into the complete web page, and begins rendering it on the screen. This involves interpreting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to create the visual layout and interactive elements.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>7. Fetching Additional Resources:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The browser doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there! It also fetches any linked CSS stylesheets to apply styling and visual formatting to the page content.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It also fetches JavaScript files, which add dynamic behavior and interactive features to the page, enhancing user experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>8. Page Fully Displayed:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Once all resources are received and rendered, the web page appears in its full glory, ready for user interaction. This entire process usually happens within a few seconds, making the web feel seamless and responsive.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h3 id="under-the-hood-protocols-powering-the-web">Under the Hood: Protocols Powering the Web&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>While we&amp;rsquo;ve explored the user-facing journey of accessing a web page, a complex network of protocols operates behind the scenes, ensuring smooth communication and data exchange. Let&amp;rsquo;s peek into some of the most important protocols for web development:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):&lt;/strong> The very language of the web! HTTP governs communication between browsers and servers. It dictates how requests are formatted, how responses are sent, and the overall flow of information. Every click, every image download, every interaction on a website relies on HTTP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):&lt;/strong> Adding a layer of security to HTTP, HTTPS encrypts communication between browsers and servers using SSL/TLS protocols. This protects sensitive information like login credentials and financial data from eavesdropping and manipulation. In today&amp;rsquo;s online world, using HTTPS is essential for building trust and ensuring user privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):&lt;/strong> These two protocols form the backbone of internet communication. TCP ensures reliable data delivery by breaking down information into packets, sequencing them, and requesting retransmission if any are lost. IP, on the other hand, routes these packets through the internet maze, using unique IP addresses to identify devices and networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>4. DNS (Domain Name System):&lt;/strong> Remember the internet&amp;rsquo;s phonebook? That&amp;rsquo;s DNS! It translates human-readable domain names like &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.example.com">www.example.com&lt;/a>: &lt;a href="https://www.example.com">https://www.example.com&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; into numerical IP addresses that computers understand. This simplifies the user experience and allows us to remember names instead of complex numbers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5. FTP (File Transfer Protocol):&lt;/strong> This protocol facilitates the transfer of files between computers on the internet. Often used by developers to upload website files to web servers, FTP ensures reliable and efficient file transfer with features like progress tracking and error recovery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>6. REST (REpresentational State Transfer):&lt;/strong> A popular architectural style for designing web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), REST relies on HTTP requests and responses to exchange data between applications. Its simplicity, scalability, and widespread adoption make it a favorite for building modern web services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>7. GraphQL:&lt;/strong> An alternative to REST, GraphQL allows clients (frontends) to specify exactly the data they need from an API. This can lead to more efficient data transfer and less server load compared to fetching everything with REST.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are just a few of the crucial protocols powering the web. Understanding their roles and functions equips you as a web developer to navigate the complex technological landscape, build efficient and secure web applications, and contribute to the ever-evolving digital world.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="web-browsers-compatibility-chameleons">Web Browsers: Compatibility Chameleons&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Remember, not all browsers are created equal. Different versions and capabilities can lead to inconsistencies in how websites appear and function. This is the challenge of &lt;strong>web browser compatibility&lt;/strong>. As developers, we must strive to make our creations adaptable, chameleon-like, adjusting to the diverse landscape of browsers our users inhabit.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="-practice-zone-2">💻 Practice Zone&lt;/h4>

&lt;h2 id="static-vs-dynamic-websites-two-flavors-of-the-web-cake">Static vs. Dynamic Websites: Two Flavors of the Web Cake&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Imagine a website as a bakery. &lt;strong>Static websites&lt;/strong> are like pre-baked cookies, delicious and fixed in form. They offer stability and simplicity, perfect for informational portals or personal portfolios. On the other hand, &lt;strong>dynamic websites&lt;/strong> are like freshly baked cakes, responsive and ever-changing. They use scripting languages and databases to personalize experiences and interact with users, making them ideal for e-commerce platforms or social media.

&lt;h3 id="web-20-and-web-30-evolution-of-the-webs-dna">Web 2.0 and Web 3.0: Evolution of the Web&amp;rsquo;s DNA&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The web is constantly evolving, and we&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed two major leaps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Web 2.0:&lt;/strong> Remember MySpace and Facebook? They ushered in an era of user-generated content and social interaction, turning the web from a one-way street to a bustling marketplace of ideas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Web 3.0:&lt;/strong> Prepare for the &amp;ldquo;semantic web,&amp;rdquo; where AI and machine learning personalize your experience even further. Imagine websites that understand your context and preferences, anticipating your needs before you even express them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../web_evolution.webp" alt="Web Evolution">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="frontend-and-backend-teamwork-makes-the-dream-work">Frontend and Backend: Teamwork Makes the Dream Work&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Developing a website is like building a house. The &lt;strong>frontend&lt;/strong> is the beautiful facade, the part users see and interact with. It&amp;rsquo;s made of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the bricks and mortar of visual design and interactivity. Think of it as the paint, windows, and doors that make the house inviting and functional.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>On the other hand, the &lt;strong>backend&lt;/strong> is the powerhouse engine and data storage, hidden behind the scenes but crucial for the house to function. Languages like Python and Java come into play here, ensuring smooth data processing, secure information handling, and efficient database management. It&amp;rsquo;s like the foundation, plumbing, and electrical wiring that keep the house standing and everything running smoothly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Think of it this way:&lt;/strong> When you enter a website, you see the buttons, pictures, and text – that&amp;rsquo;s the frontend. But when you click a button, log in, or make a purchase, the backend machinery kicks in, processing your request, retrieving data from the database, and sending it back to the frontend to update what you see on your screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-two-sides-work-together-seamlessly">The two sides work together seamlessly:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Frontend developers&lt;/strong> are the architects and interior designers, building the visible structure and user experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Backend developers&lt;/strong> are the engineers and plumbers, ensuring the underlying systems are secure, efficient, and performant.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Both are essential for a successful website, just like both the facade and the foundation are crucial for a strong house.&lt;/strong>
&lt;img src="../intro_scripting.png" alt="Scripting">&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="web-engineering">Web Engineering&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="web-project-lifecycle-from-dream-to-reality">Web Project Lifecycle: From Dream to Reality&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Every amazing website starts as a seed of an idea. The &lt;strong>web project lifecycle&lt;/strong> takes that seed and nurtures it into a flourishing digital garden. It involves meticulous &lt;strong>requirements gathering,&lt;/strong> creating blueprints like &lt;strong>wireframes,&lt;/strong> and then employing development methodologies like the &lt;strong>agile process&lt;/strong> to break down tasks into manageable sprints. Finally, we employ the &lt;strong>multi-tier architecture,&lt;/strong> the three-layered cake of browser, web server, and database, to bring the website to life in a secure and efficient manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h3 id="heres-a-closer-look-at-the-phases">Here&amp;rsquo;s a closer look at the phases:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Requirements Gathering:&lt;/strong> This is where we understand the client&amp;rsquo;s vision, target audience, and website goals. It&amp;rsquo;s like talking to the homeowner to understand their needs and desired outcome for the house.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wireframing:&lt;/strong> This is creating a rough sketch of the website&amp;rsquo;s layout and functionality. It&amp;rsquo;s like drawing the floor plan of the house before construction begins.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Agile Development:&lt;/strong> This is a flexible approach where we break down the project into small, iterative tasks and work in short sprints. It&amp;rsquo;s like building the house room by room, constantly testing and refining as we go.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Multi-Tier Architecture:&lt;/strong> This is the layered structure of the website, with the browser at the top interacting with the web server, which in turn communicates with the database. It&amp;rsquo;s like the different floors of the house, each with its own purpose and connected through stairs and hallways.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>By following this lifecycle, we ensure that websites are built efficiently, meet user needs, and are adaptable to future changes. Here is a more detailed discussion on these concepts:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h3 id="requirements-gathering">Requirements Gathering&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is where we understand the client’s vision, target audience, and website goals. It’s like talking to the homeowner to understand their needs and desired outcome for the house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to understand a holistic picture of the requirements, we need to first specify the stakeholders, which are anyone affected by the product such as end users, policymakers, domain experts, etc. Then, we use different methods such as interviews, focus groups, surveys, and on-site observation to elicit requirements from stakeholders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each of the methods serves a different purpose and exposes aspects that cannot be seen by others. For instance, surveys are used for short yes/no or pre-defined answers where the goal is to validate a piece of information on a large scale, while interviews are used to uncover deep insights from people in a specific area. For example, let’s assume you are trying to build a web app that will help computer science students choose their career path after graduation. There are many questions you need to answer in order to understand the problem very well, then build an effective solution for it. Some examples include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How easy or hard is it for current CS students to choose their career path? (Survey question)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are the current fears/concerns that students face? (Start with an interview then run a survey to validate on a bigger scale)?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why do they have these fears/concerns? (Interview)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What questions do they have about CS career paths? (Interviews)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are their current ways they use to overcome those fears (interview/observation)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These questions will uncover important issues and insight. A deep analysis of the information that we got will result on some ideas on how to address the issues. Indeed, any project given its limited budget and resources will not be able to address all the issues, however, we will focus on the most important issues and turn them into functional and non-functional requirements. These requirements are part of the Software Requirements Document (SRS).&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="practice-zone">Practice Zone&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Think of a problem that you’ve encountered yourself in your educational journey.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are some questions that will help you understand the problem more deeply?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Which research method will help you answer each questions?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Practice asking one of these questions with your colleague (take turns)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="wireframing">Wireframing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is creating a rough sketch of the website’s layout and functionality. It is like drawing the floor plan of the house before construction begins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The goal of wireframing is to document and understand how the system will function from a user point of view. It is also called the low fidelity prototype of the system. It is used to discover all the possible interactions that a user can accomplish with your web app. It is also used to explore different ways of interaction and test their effectiveness before implementing them into real products. For instance, going back to our previous career path web app example, we can design two wireframes for the home page, each offering distinct features to cater to the diverse needs of computer science students.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the first wireframe, we prioritize a clean and intuitive interface. The homepage clearly displays categories such as &amp;lsquo;Programming,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Data Science,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Networking,&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Cybersecurity,&amp;rsquo; allowing users to easily navigate to their area of interest. A concise menu at the top provides quick access to essential tools, such as career quizzes, industry insights, and a personalized dashboard. Additionally, a visually appealing infographic showcases trending technologies and job opportunities, offering a quick glance at the dynamic landscape of the tech industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In contrast, the second wireframe adopts a more interactive approach. The homepage features a personalized onboarding process, where users are prompted to answer a series of questions about their skills, preferences, and career goals. Based on their responses, the app dynamically generates a customized career roadmap, recommending specific courses, internships, and networking events tailored to their individual needs. A chatbot in the corner provides instant assistance and encourages user engagement, fostering a sense of guidance and community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These two wireframes exemplify the flexibility of wireframing as a design tool, allowing us to explore different user experiences and functionalities before committing to a final design for our career path web app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wireframes are designed using a variety of tools from as simple as sketching on a paper to specialized tools like Figma, which has many features that makes it easy for user interface designers to design web apps and mobile apps. Those features include designing for different screens, prototyping, assets management, and many 3rd party plugins that helps make the workflow much easier for both designers and developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When designing wireframes, designers usually go from low fidelity (level of details) to high fidelity designs. Developers expect the wireframes to be as close as to the end product screens. They expect wireframes to include the following details:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Navigational links&lt;/strong>: Each screen’s interactive parts should have links to their destination screens. This will form what is called a prototype. The developer will be able to interact with the prototype before its development.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ready to export assets&lt;/strong>: Each screen has a set of images, icons and even animations. These need to be ready for export in terms of meaning, sizes for different screens resolutions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A design system:&lt;/strong> throughout the design, there will be certain components that will be reused multiple times such as colors, fonts, buttons, interactions, and other UI controls. These are usually put in a separate page in Figma as a reference so that developers can refer to them instead of working with each different instance in each page.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Sharing the wireframe with developers in Figma is as easy as sharing the link with them or adding them as collaborators in the project. Developers will be able to enable “Dev Mode” and start implementing the designs to real code.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="agile-development">Agile Development&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is a flexible approach where we break down the project into small, iterative tasks and work in short sprints. It’s like building the house room by room, constantly testing and refining as we go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In real life businesses, there are a lot of variables that tend to change all the time, such as market needs, new technologies, stakeholder opinions, new insights, customer behavior, seasonal events and many other stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is good about software products is the ability to build them in chunks and keep evolving them with time, unlike physical products like cars and buildings. For example, you can launch the career path web app with only a home page that asks students to fill in some questions that will later help you improve the app much better. However, it is much harder to apply the same concept to cars, you cannot for example launch a car without tires or without seats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This advantage of software products relieved developers from the need to decide on all of the product features from the beginning of the project. Instead, a software product team can decided on a set of “Version 1” features and discover the rest later on based on customers&amp;rsquo; feedback. And this is especially applicable for web applications where end users do not have to “Update” their existing software to get the new features. It is just a matter of the developers deploy the new changes and they will be available to end users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many existing project management methods that are based on the concept of agile such Scrum, Lean, etc. The details of each of these is out of the scope of this course, however, they are all agile methods that share following ideas:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Incremental delivery&lt;/strong>: Each increment will go through the defining a small set of requirements, designing them into user interfaces and software models, building them into final products “Code”, launching or deploying them to end users, validating them through customer feedback, and repeat.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Customer satisfaction first&lt;/strong>: As mentioned in the last step of the incremental delivery, customer satisfaction is what will mainly drive the definition of the requirements of the next iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Small teams:&lt;/strong> To be able to move faster, reduce the scheduling hassles, minimize the amount of documentation and reporting, agile teams tend to be small and all are on the same page. In such teams, a common ritual is what is called a standup meeting, that is a quick daily meeting that brings everyone onboard by allowing every member to share: what they have accomplished, what is their plan and if they have any obstacles.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Minimal documentation:&lt;/strong> The focus in agile team is to be productive and work on what matters. Traditional long documentation tend to change a lot which cost so much of productive time. Instead in agile teams, documentation is only done purposefully if it will add value for the product.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Overall simplicity:&lt;/strong> Simplicity is more of a mindset than a process. Embracing it overall will urge each team member starting with the leader to question each action if it will add unnecessary complexity or if it will move the progress forward. It will also have an direct effect on the design team, development team, and the business team while accomplishing their tasks.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Going back to the problem that you though of previously, think of the minimal set of features that you can build to address the problem.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Search the internet of the Scrum &amp;amp; Lean methods and compare/contrast them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="multi-tier-architecture">Multi-Tier Architecture&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../multitier.png" alt="Two tire">
This is the layered structure of the website, with the browser at the top interacting with the web server, which in turn communicates with the database. It’s like the different floors of the house, each with its own purpose and connected through stairs and hallways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A multi-tier architecture in web applications means the separation of the different high level components of a web application. In its simplest form, the 2-tier architecture, the front-end (Client side code) is separated than the back-end (Server side code). The goal of separating the different components of a web application is to reduce dependency which will result in easier reusability of different components. For instance, having one “Back-End” and multiple clients, or in simple words a mobile app interface, a web app interface that connects to the same back-end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another important reason why a multi-tier architecture is used is to allow clients with less computing resources to accomplish intensive processing tasks efficiently. In this case, the client-side code will call APIs (over HTTP, mostly) along with parameters, initiating the processing on the server side. The server, equipped with robust computational capabilities, handles resource-intensive tasks, such as complex algorithms, data analysis, or heavy computations related to career recommendations in our application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For instance, in our application, when a user requests a personalized career roadmap based on their skills and preferences, the client-side code sends a request to the server-side API, transmitting relevant parameters. The server then utilizes its processing power to analyze vast datasets, perform algorithmic calculations, and generate a tailored career plan. Once the processing is complete, the results are sent back to the client-side, where they are seamlessly integrated into the user interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This division of labor not only optimizes the utilization of computing resources but also ensures a smooth user experience, as clients with varying device capabilities can efficiently access and benefit from the application. The multi-tier architecture, with its clear separation of concerns between client and server, enhances scalability, maintainability, and performance in applications dealing with resource-intensive tasks like career path recommendations for aspiring computer science students.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
