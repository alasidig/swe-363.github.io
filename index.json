If you are viewing this page on laptop or any device with a biger screen, you can name these tags.\nThe \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; may be used at the top of the page. Then after that, you may have navigation ( \u0026lt;nav\u0026gt;)to the right and sometimes also the navigation is moved below the header. And at the bottom, we will have a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt;. Which is going to list some links like contacts or useful links or sitemap.\nThe \u0026lt;main\u0026gt; section holds the main content of the page. And it can be divided into \u0026lt;sections\u0026gt;. Each section will have its \u0026lt;header\u0026gt;, which contains a title for that section, and may have an \u0026lt;article\u0026gt; that contains the content of this section, and it also may have a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; to conclude this section. And then after that, you can have another \u0026lt;section\u0026gt; or so on.\nBefore every HTML5, these tags were not there, and people were only using the \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; tag. then they either give it an id equal to main or they give it a class named main or something like that to distinguish from others.\nAlright, so now whenever we design our webpage, would like to have these tags. These tags will help the search engines to index our page well. When it finds something in the main it would say that this is the main topic of the page. And when it finds something in a section it\u0026rsquo;s going to say that this section is about this topic.\nSemantic Tags in Action The following video shows the usage of semantic tags in twitter website.

Depending on how ripe or sweet your banana and orange are, you may need to add a little extra honey, so add based on your taste. There are many additions you can make. For a green smoothie, add 1/2 cup to 1 cup of fresh greens like spinach or kale. You can also add more fruit. Add 1/2 cup of strawberries, mango, frozen berries, pineapple, or other favorite fruit. Makes 2 kid-size smoothies or 1 large You Will Need 1 banana 1/2 orange, peeled and quartered 1/3 cup Greek yogurt 1/4 cup water or milk (dairy or non-dairy) 1 to 2 teaspoons honey, optional Directions Roughly chop the banana and orange quarters, and then add to a blender. Top with yogurt and water (or milk). Turn blender on and blend until creamy and smooth. Taste, and then adjust with honey if needed. Adam and Joanne's Tips How to Freeze or Make Ahead: This recipe makes one smoothie or two kid-size smoothies. Enjoy now, or save for later. To save the smoothie for later, pour each serving into a food-safe resealable plastic bag or container and freeze. Then, about an hour before needing the smoothie, take it out from the freezer. Non-Dairy alternatives: If you are looking for a banana smoothie without yogurt, then simply leave the yogurt out of the recipe above and replace it with more banana, a tablespoon or so of nut butter, mango, or a tablespoon of hemp seeds (great protein source). You may need to add additional water or non-dairy milk to thin the smoothie out a little. Nutrition facts: The nutrition facts provided below are estimates.
