If you are viewing this page on laptop or any device with a biger screen, you can name these tags.\nThe \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; may be used at the top of the page. Then after that, you may have navigation ( \u0026lt;nav\u0026gt;)to the right and sometimes also the navigation is moved below the header. And at the bottom, we will have a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt;. Which is going to list some links like contacts or useful links or sitemap.\nThe \u0026lt;main\u0026gt; section holds the main content of the page. And it can be divided into \u0026lt;sections\u0026gt;. Each section will have its \u0026lt;header\u0026gt;, which contains a title for that section, and may have an \u0026lt;article\u0026gt; that contains the content of this section, and it also may have a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; to conclude this section. And then after that, you can have another \u0026lt;section\u0026gt; or so on.\nBefore every HTML5, these tags were not there, and people were only using the \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; tag. then they either give it an id equal to main or they give it a class named main or something like that to distinguish from others.\nAlright, so now whenever we design our webpage, would like to have these tags. These tags will help the search engines to index our page well. When it finds something in the main it would say that this is the main topic of the page. And when it finds something in a section it\u0026rsquo;s going to say that this section is about this topic.\nSemantic Tags in Action The following video shows the usage of semantic tags in twitter website.

Depending on how ripe or sweet your banana and orange are, you may need to add a little extra honey, so add based on your taste. There are many additions you can make. For a green smoothie, add 1/2 cup to 1 cup of fresh greens like spinach or kale. You can also add more fruit. Add 1/2 cup of strawberries, mango, frozen berries, pineapple, or other favorite fruit. Makes 2 kid-size smoothies or 1 large You Will Need 1 banana 1/2 orange, peeled and quartered 1/3 cup Greek yogurt 1/4 cup water or milk (dairy or non-dairy) 1 to 2 teaspoons honey, optional Directions Roughly chop the banana and orange quarters, and then add to a blender. Top with yogurt and water (or milk). Turn blender on and blend until creamy and smooth. Taste, and then adjust with honey if needed. Adam and Joanne's Tips How to Freeze or Make Ahead: This recipe makes one smoothie or two kid-size smoothies. Enjoy now, or save for later. To save the smoothie for later, pour each serving into a food-safe resealable plastic bag or container and freeze. Then, about an hour before needing the smoothie, take it out from the freezer. Non-Dairy alternatives: If you are looking for a banana smoothie without yogurt, then simply leave the yogurt out of the recipe above and replace it with more banana, a tablespoon or so of nut butter, mango, or a tablespoon of hemp seeds (great protein source). You may need to add additional water or non-dairy milk to thin the smoothie out a little. Nutrition facts: The nutrition facts provided below are estimates.

An interactive website allows users to input data using forms. Forms are frontend to backend data transformers.\nFor example, if we are going to design a website for fast food. The front end should show some images of the meals. And also the user should be able to click somewhere on the page to add to the shopping cart. And when checking out, he should be able to set his address to deliver the food in a form. So all that should be done on the front end. But we also need to pass data from the front end to the back end so that the admin of this restaurant to be able to serve this customer. The admin will have another view which talks to the database and tell the admin that some person here is ordering a meal and he would like to get it in that address.\nForms usually include a series of HTML \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; tags. There are many other tags, but input is the most used. Before HTML 5 there was a limited number of data entry controls that are available. In HTML 5 there are controls for entering text, choosing from a list of buttons and checkboxes, radio buttons ..etc. HTML 5 also added more new controls that we can use to customize options for existing controls.\nWorked Example Let\u0026rsquo;s create a simple form that asks the user for a feedback. The required fields includes his name, phone, and a message.  \nThe form starts from line 10 where we added the \u0026lt;form\u0026gt; tag. Then followed by an \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; tag for the user name, then another one for the phone, and finally a \u0026lt;textarea\u0026gt; to hold the message. The \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; tags are used to format the fields to show in a vertical column because the \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;textarea\u0026gt; are inline elements. Click on the green button to see the output.\nThe \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; field \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;user\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter your name\u0026#34; required\u0026gt;  It is a self closing tag The type attribute can have many values like number, email, password, \u0026hellip;etc. It is helpful for simple validation and will render a sutable keyboard on the smartphones. The placeholder attribute is used to display a helping string to the the user what should he input in this field. The required attribute is used to force the user to fill the field before submission. The name attribute is used to communicate the entered values to the server. When submitting this form, a dictionary of keys and values will be created. The keys are what is being assigned to the name attribute. And the values are the user response for each field. Try to change the name attribute for the first \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; to user2 and see the result. Setting the type to submit will create a button to submit the form and enable submitting the form by just pressing the enter key on the keyboard. There are many other attributes not added here such as value, onkeyup, \u0026hellip;  The \u0026lt;textarea\u0026gt; field  It is used to enable the user to enter more than one line of text. There are some other attributes not added here such as rows, cols,\u0026hellip;  The \u0026lt;form\u0026gt; tag \u0026lt;form action=\u0026#34;result.html\u0026#34; method=\u0026#34;get\u0026#34;\u0026gt;  It wraps the input fields. The action attribute tels where to submit the form. It accept the URL of the server that will process the form data. Since we are only discussing the frontend now, the server side script will not be discussed. There are many other attributes not added here such as onsubmit, enctype, \u0026hellip; The method attribute determines how to submit the form. It can be set to get or post. There are some differences between the two methods as shown in the following video     Exercises Company hiring form   Expand  Create a web page for a company of your choice it should contain some description, products, images, and a large title: We are hiring join us by filling this application. the title should link to a page that contains the following form:  Restaurant Table Reservation   Expand  create a web page for a restaurant. it should contain an image and a list of meals with some description. it should contain a link to another page that contains a form to reserve a table like the following.\n More Resources  Your first form  Basic native form controls  The HTML5 input types  Creating Accessible Forms   ","date":1641969401,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641969401,"objectID":"d1ae7f63919738e88b7821bf5bf7530f","permalink":"http://alasidig.github.io/swe-363.github.io/courses/swe363/html/advanced/","publishdate":"2022-01-12T09:36:41+03:00","relpermalink":"/swe-363.github.io/courses/swe363/html/advanced/","section":"courses","summary":"Some advanced tags in HTML like forms and tables.","tags":["html","front-end","form-fields"],"title":"HTML Advanced","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Objectives Learn the basics of using CSS for styling websites.\nIntroduction In web development the rule of Cascade Style Sheets is to control how the contents are presented to the user.

It is recommended that you write the code your self before expanding the given solution. Try to avoid coping and pasting.\nHTML code In the HTML body, we would like to start drawing this 😀. We can have a \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; with the class smiley. And inside this div, we would like to have two other divs, one for each eye, and one for the mouth. Still, we can\u0026rsquo;t see anything on the browser because these divs by default don\u0026rsquo;t have any size unless you give them some content inside.\n  Index.html  \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;style2.css\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Smile Please\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hover Over Me to Smile!!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;smiley\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;eyes\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;leftEye\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;eyes\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;rightEye\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- for entertainment add cheeks --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;cheeks\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;cheeks\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;mouth\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt;   CSS Styling Now let\u0026rsquo;s start the styling. We would like firstly to style the smiley class. Firstly, to show it on the screen, we need to give it height and width since we don\u0026rsquo;t have any content in this div. By default, it\u0026rsquo;s going to take the full widht of the screen because it is a block element. Then, change the background-color to gold.\nStyling the face   smiley class CSS rules  .smiley{ height: 200px; width: 200px; /* let us give it some background-color: ; */ background-color: gold; }   We would like to give it some space around it and move it away from the edge. To do that, we can use the margin property. The margin is the space around the element outside the border while the padding is space around the content.\n  smiley class CSS rules  .smiley{ height: 200px; width: 200px; /* let us give it some background-color: ; */ background-color: gold; /* let us move it away from the edges */ margin: 25%; }   We can also, add a border around the face. For the border property, you choose the color, style, and thickness. So let\u0026rsquo;s add a black solid 2px thick border. but we are not limited to these named colors. Hovering over the word ‘black’ in VSCode will popup the color chooser utility to select any color. The color can be represented as a blend of red, green, and blue with different ratios.   smiley class CSS rules  .smiley{ height: 200px; width: 200px; /* let us give it some background-color: ; */ background-color: gold; /* let us move it away from the edges */ margin: 25%; /* let us add border to the face. now let us use a different way to add colors border*/ border: black solid 5px; }   So we gave it now a border, but the face doesn\u0026rsquo;t look square right? So to change that we can use the border-radius. The border-radius specifies how rounded the corner should be. we would like the face to be completely round. This means the border-radius should be at least half of the width 100px. we can use relative units (50%) and let CSS handle the calculation\n  smiley class CSS rules  .smiley{ height: 200px; width: 200px; /* let us give it some background-color: ; */ background-color: gold; /* let us move it away from the edges */ margin: 25%; /* let us add border to the face. now let us use a different way to add colors border*/ border: rgb(45, 45, 45) solid 5px; /* but the face shouldn\u0026#39;t be a square */ border-radius: 50%; }   Styling the mouth So inside the 😀 we are having eyes and a mouth. The mouth needs size and background color to show up. Let us add height and width and a black 10px thick border.   mouth class CSS rules  .mouth{ height: 50px; width: 75px; border-bottom: #2d2d2d solid 10px; }  \nFace Layout OK, but this is not where the mouth should be. To move it to the right location, we can think of the face as a 5x5 grid. The mouth should be in the forth row and spanning three columns as in this figure: The line marks the starting of the column or a row. to do that we can change the display property of the .smiley to grid and set the templates for rows and columns.   smiley class CSS rules  .smiley{ height: 200px; width: 200px; /* let us give it some background-color: ; */ background-color: gold; /* let us move it away from the edges */ margin: 25%; /* let us add border to the face. now let us use a different way to add colors border*/ border: black solid 5px; display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(5,1fr); grid-template-rows: repeat(5,40px); place-items: center; }  \nWhit that done, now we can style the mouth and move it to the correct place.   mouth class CSS rules  .mouth{ height: 50px; width: 75px; border-bottom: #2d2d2d solid 10px; grid-row: 4; grid-column: 2/5; }  \nStyling the eyes Similarly, we can style the eyes. Since the two eyes share common style, we can add the common CSS properties to the eyes class and use the ids for the distinct styles   eyes class CSS rules  .eyes{ width: 25px; height: 45px; background-color: #2d2d2d; /* make them oval */ border-radius: 50%; }  \n  Right and left eye CSS rules  #leftEye{ grid-column: 2; grid-row: 2; } #rightEye{ grid-column: 4; grid-row: 2; }   Adding the cheeks The cheeks style is similar ot the eyes. The differences are the color and the position. For the color, instead of a single solid color, a fancy gradient color is used.   cheeks class CSS rules  .cheeks{ width: 35px; height: 45px; background:radial-gradient(circle,red,pink); border-radius: 50%; opacity: 35%; grid-row: 3; }   To move the right cheek to the right, we can select it using the pseudo class nth-of-type   Right cheek CSS rules  div.cheeks:nth-of-type(2n){ grid-column: 5; }  \nAnimation Let us now finally smile 😊. For this we use hover pseudo class. For the eyes, we would like to change their width and height.\n  Smiling eyes CSS rules  .smiley:hover .eyes{ width: 45px; height: 25px; }   For the mouth, we would like to change the width, height, and border-radius.\n  Smiling mouth CSS rules  /* the mouth should expand and become rounded*/ .smiley:hover .mouth{ width: 100px; height: 50px; border-radius: 50%; }   The cheeks should be hidden and only be shown on hover. This can be done using the opacity. In the .cheeks class change the css opacity: 35%;  to css opacity: 0;  to hide the cheeks.\n  Smiling cheeks CSS rules  .smiley:hover .cheeks{ opacity: 35%; }   Finally to have a smooth transition we can set the duration of state-change to 1 second. To do that, use the transition property. This should be added to eyes, cheeks, and mouth. Instead of repeating the same rule in different places, we can use the * selector to select all the children of .smiley div.\n  Smooth animation  .smiley \u0026gt;*{ transition: 1s ; }  \nExercises Suggested changes on the example  Add different animations like 😂 or 🤣 ro 🤩 Replace the grid-template-columns by grid-template-areas Replace the grid by flex Re-implement using position instead of grid  Webpages styling Deserts of the world   Expand  Fork the repl on the following link https://replit.com/@alasidig/cssimages#index.html then follow the comments on the style.css to make the page looks like the following image\n URL Shortener   Expand  Fork the following repository https://github.com/alasidig/url-shortener then following the style guide in style-guide.md, start styling the page until it looks like the image in the design/desktop-active-states.jpg.
